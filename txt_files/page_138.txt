2.4.2 STATISTICAL INFORMATION -"PATH 2"
This path provides statistics about the cost variables. For
each run of the DARPASS program, the user may choose to
receive information about the variable(s) that have been
selected. In relative terms, this information shows the
effect on cost of each variable independently and the total
relative cost effect of all variables together. The
reference costs represent expenditure under baseline
conditions. Baseline conditions are the traditional, "start
from scratch" method for developing flight hardware with
many of the inherent inefficiencies. For example: if the
user had selected four variables to evaluate during the
input session, DARPASS would provide information on the cost
effect of each individual variable and also the combined
effect of all four.
