2.5.1 FILE MAINTENANCE
The first function provides for display and manipulation of
configuration files. When an input file is saved (See SAVE
CONFIGURATION -DARPASS Program Operations menu), it is
saved with a special file extension (.FIG) that identifies
it as a DARPASS configuration file. Displayed in the sample
menu below are the options available with this file
maintenance function:
File Operations
List Configuration Files
List All Files
Delete Configuration File
The LIST CONFIGURATION FILES option provides a CRT-displayed
list of the DARPASS configuration files currently stored on
disk. The user can specify the disk drive from which the
configuration files will be read and listed. If necessary,
the user can also specify a "path" to a subdirectory.
The second option, LIST ALL FILES, provides a CRT-displayed
list of all files currently stored on disk. Again, the user
can specify the disk drive and/or subdirectory from which
the files are to be listed.
DELETE CONFIGURATION FILE lets the user delete obsolete
configuration files. He/she is prompted for the file to be
deleted and may only delete files from the current "default"
directory, i.e., disk drive or subdirectory designations are
not permitted. Wildcards also cannot be used in this
deletion process.
