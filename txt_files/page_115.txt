prime contractor must coordinate many subcontractors. This
variable also addresses the cost impact of the relationships
between the prime contractor and its teammates and/or
subcontractors.

Qualitative Scale
B) Teammate effort represents large amount of the total
effort (from a cost value reference). Many critical
flight components are spread amongst many different
contractors. Working relationships are slow to
develop. Poor support from many of the team members.
Many new teammates involved without structured channels
of communication.
1) Teammate effort represents greater than half of the
total effort (from a cost value reference). Some
critical flight components are spread between many
different contractors. There are many new teammates.
Teammates appear supportive of the prime contractor.
Proper channels of communication are still being
developed.
2) Teammate effort represents between 25 and 50% of the
total effort (from a cost value reference). Critical
flight components are generally apportioned by
teammates. Prime contractor has established good
working relationships with teammates. Teammates are
actively involved in most important contract issues.
3) Teammate effort represents less then 25% of the total
effort. Prime contractor has worked extensively with
teammates. Critical flight components are segregated
by teammates. Working relationships appear excellent
with all members actively participating.
