"Path 2" allows the user to obtain the impact of the cost
variables as a percent of the baseline cost. The baseline
cost values represent the cost of the spacecraft under
traditional, "start from scratch" development conditions.
The menu used when deciding between "Path 1" -cost
information and "Path 2" -statistical information looks
like this:
Output Information
Cost Information
Statistical Information
The second option, STATISTICAL INFORMATION, allows the user
to either compare the cost savings of individual variables
or the cost saving approaches of multiple variables. This
information is somewhat independent of a typical prime
contractor's light satellite design baseline as it provides
relative cost savings for alternate approaches rather than
discrete cost values reflecting a specific design.
