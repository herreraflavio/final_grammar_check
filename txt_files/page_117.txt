3) ENHANCING PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES DURING PRODUCTION
This cost variable addresses the cost impacts and associated
cost savings when incorporating production efficient
technology improvements during the production segment of the
contract. It is generally expensive to incorporate changes
during the production cycle because of retooling, drawing
modifications, and other issues. However, there are
instances where the cost savings of certain activities
outweigh the cost of implementing them. Weight:
Oualitative Scale
B) No impact to production activities due to technology
improvements. Technclogy improvements are not
incorporated during the production segment.
1) Very few production technology improvements
incorporated during the production process. Most of
these improvements are of limited economic
consequences; incorporating them is fairly inexpensive.
2) There are some significant technology upgrades to the
production process integrated during the production
effort. These upgrades provide some cost reduction
improvement in the production activities. Cost of
incorporating these changes versus the cost savings
realized makes the upgrades attractive.3) Incorporation of advanced technology into the
production process. Use of highly specialized
robotics. Significant cost efficiencies are achieved
from the introduction of this new technology. Cost of
implementing the production system enhancements is
significantly outweighed by the savings.

Notes:
-Some effects of this variable cause increase in cost while
others decrease cost.
-Only Production parameters inputs are affected.
