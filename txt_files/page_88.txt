2.3.3 BASELINE PRODUCTION
Production represented "building to print" the
spacecraft baseline designed in the Development
Phase using the techniques and equipment
established/built in the PEP segment. The
Production Phase included most of the recurring
costs associated with building a spacecraft.
Production Phase assumptions were as follows:
1) All economic conditions associated with
production were identical to that of PEP.
2) All appropriate assumptions from Development
and PEP still applied.
3) Production included lots of 5, 25, 50, 100,
and 150.
4) Under "business as usual" conditions, it was
assumed that there was a certain amount of
change traffic during the production process
that increased somewhat proportionately with
each production quantity.
5) The quantities did not reflect en masse
production, rather a product that was
Uevolving as user demands were accommodated.
User demands did not include block changes.
6) Appropriate learning curves or prnduct
improvement factors were applied dependiag on
quantity, item, and process.
7) The production effort did not include
nonrecurring costs.
8) The baseline included a rigorous test
program.
9) The production run was assumed to be a
continuous build activity peaking at five
spacecraft per month.
10) Funding was not a production consideration.
