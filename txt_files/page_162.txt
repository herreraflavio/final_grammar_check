A) COST INFORMATION DISPLAY TABLES
These display tables provide the cost values for the Light
Satellite conceptual design. There are four choices for
displaying the cost data that may be selected through the DATA
LEVEL Menu. Each choi.e is explained below.
DATA LEVEL
1 -Spacecraft Totals
2 -Subsystem Level
3 -Component Parts
4 -Totals Only
1 -SPACECRAFT TOTALS allows the user to retrieve up to ten
spacecraft/payload summary items of his/her choosing. The user
dictates which components fall under a "summary item" by
providing the component item identification codes. This
operation may be performed through the Maintenance Option (see
FILE OPERATIONS/ MAINTENANCE).
The ten (or less) spacecraft/payload summary items appear in this
output report. The component items that have been identified
with a summary item, will have costs aggregated into a total that
is then displayed for each summary item. An example of this
output table is shown below. (Menu selections: SPACECRAFT
