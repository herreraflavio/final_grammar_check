11) LAUNCH VEHICLE SIZE AND WEIGHT CONSTRAINTS
This variable addresses the cost impact to development when
the spacecraft/payload is approaching the limits of the lift
capabilities of the launch vehicle. This variable assumes
that all weight related issues are addressed during design
and PEP, therefore, no impact to production is realized.
Weight:
Oualitative Scale
B) Very tight size/weight constraints due to launch
vehicle limitations. Essentially no margin for growth
in the spacecraft/payload preliminary design. Changes
to baseline in one subsystem impact other subsystems
due to redesign, incorporation of changes, and
maintenance of size and weight limits; result is an
inflexible design.
1) Tight size/weight constraints with 5% to 10% growth
margins. Any design changes may require redesign of
existing subsystem components. Major rework to design
is required when weight limitations exceeded.
2) More relaxed size/weight constraints with 10% to 20%
growth margins. Most changes can be made with a
minimum degree of impact on existing components and
subsystems. Some small redesign efforts may be
required to incorporate changes that result in weight
Mm growth.
3) Size and weight limitations not projected to be an
issue. Large margin for growth (+20%). Little or no
redesign required for incorporating chpnges that result
in weight growth.
