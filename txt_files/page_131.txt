These options let the user save, and later retrieve, a
configuration of cost variables. "Configuration" represents
the Primary and Secondary cost variables that were selected
during data input (Section 2.2).
SAVE CONFIGURATION saves the selected variable ratings i.e.,
baseline, option 1, option 2, etc., so that the costs
associated with a specific approach to developing the
hardware can be repeated. Following is an example of the
menu displayed when the user decides to save a file. File
retrieval uses the same method but in the reverse.
