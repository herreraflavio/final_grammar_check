SECONDARY COST VARIABLES
6) STREAMLINING MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS
This variable accounts for changes in the management
philosophy. There are controllable programmatic factors
that can reduce the level of management and streamline the
management process.
7) LEVEL OF DELIVERABLE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED
This variable addresses the cost of various levels of
required documentation. It also reveals the associated
costs of management and customer reviews.
8) SIZE/EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTION FACILITY
This variable addresses the cost impact of using a large
facility involved in many contracts and having many required
operating procedures, versus using a smaller, more
streamlined operation with additional flexible operating
procedures. This small operation could represent a special
subcontractor or a splinter operation from the main
contractor.
9) MANUAL VERSUS AUTOMATED MANUFACTURING & TEST METHODS
This variable addresses the cost savings/added costs of
using automated, autonomous type manufacturing machine tools
versus traditional labor intensive machine tools. It also
addresses the added costs/savings of using automated test
methods.
10) LEVEL OF DESIGN/TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AND UPGRADES
This variable addresses cost/savings due to incorporation of
design and technology changes during the manufacturing
process. These changes are assumed to be of minor impact
and are more of a tuning function.
11) LAUNCH VEHICLE SIZE AND WEIGHT CONSTRAINTS
This variable addresses the cost impact to development when
the spacecraft/payload is approaching the limits of the lift
capabilities of the launch vehicle. This variable assumes
that all weight related issues are addressed during design
and PEP; therefore, no impact to production is realized.
