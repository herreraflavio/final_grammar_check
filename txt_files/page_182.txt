D) STATISTICAL INFORMATION GRAPHICAL DISPLAYS
S This section describes how statistical information on the Light
Satellite conceptual design is provided in graphical form. This
option offers all combinations of statistical information except
for COMPONENT PARTS. The discrete selections provided by the
output menus are displayed below.
The reader should observe that the major difference between the
graphical display of cost information compared to statistical
information is that all statistical information is displayed in
the form of bar charts. The statistical information is more
appropriately displayed using bar charts rather than line graphs.

If the user selects either SPACECRAFT TOTALS or SUBSYSTEM LEVEL
from the Data Level menu, he/she receives one of two additional
menus. These menus allow the user to narrow the scope of output
information to specific spacecraft items or subsystems. These
menus contain a list of summary items and the user can choose the
specific items he/she wishes to view. The summary items are
configured using the Maintenance function (see FILE OPERATIONS/
MAINTENANCE). A sample Data Sublevel menu is provided on the
following page.
