The baseline cost values for the "Light Satellite"
conceptual design are displayed in Table 1.3.0. As
stated previously, these values rcrresent the "business
as usual" approach to developing the space hardware.
The values for Cost Variables one through 11 are
displayed in Tables 1.3.1.$ to 1.3.11.$. There are
three unique cost tables for each Cost Variable that
correspond to the three options evaluated for each
variable. Each table contains the data for the three
phases: Development, PEP, and Production.
The percent savings/investments by phase are also shown
in Tables 1.3.1.% to 1.3.11.%. The savings are
represented by positive values, while the cost
investments (increases) are displayed as negative
values. As with cost, there are three unique percent
tables for each Cost Variable that correspond to the
three options evaluated for each variable.
The percent values displayed in these tables are the
cost savings and investment derived when the Cost
Variables are applied independently of one another.
The savings and investment values change when Cost
Variables are applied concurrently. Generally, the
cost savings over the baseline would increase when
applying multiple variables. The mechanisms for
accomplishing this process are included in the DARPASS
Program.
--;The methodology and results are based on a point
conceptual design. For the government to see the
appropriate Aime phased'impact the parametric group
recommends that when wLightsat"lis awarded, an actual
characterization be generated and that characterization
live with the design and build life cycle. Real-time
adjustments and decisions (cost and schedule) can be
implemented from DARPASS data to arrive at the lowest
possible program cost. h
