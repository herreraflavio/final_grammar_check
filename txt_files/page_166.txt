2 -SUBSYSTEM LEVEL operates in the same manner as the previous
option, SPACECRAFT TOTALS. This function permits naming of up to
25 space division subsystem summaries. The user must again input
the component part identification codes for each summary item.
The 25 (or less) space division subsystem summary items provided
by the user will appear in the same output format as the
SPACECRAFT TOTALS table displayed above. The component items
that have been identified with each summary item will have costs
aggregated and a total cost provided for each summary item. An
example of this type of output table is provided below. The
example (as indicated by the title) displays PEP unit cost
values. (Menu selections: SUBSYSTEM LEVEL -PEP PHASE -UNIT
