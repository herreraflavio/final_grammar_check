The cost savings percents are the y-axis, and the cost variables
(one to 11) are the x-axis. The histograms represent the total
cost savings percents for different cost variables. The only
histograms that are present are those selected by the user.
Thus, there may be between one and 11 histograms. The height of
the histograms represents the absolute cost savings percents for
the Primary or Secondary Cost Variables for the summary item,
compared to the total baseline cost.
There are instances where there will be fewer histograms than the
number of Primary or Secondary Cost Variables selected. This is
because some variables may have no impact on a particular item.
3 -COMPONENT PARTS -The DARPASS does not provide graphical
displays to the component part level.
4 -TOTALS ONLY -The user receives one (1) graphical display.
The total cost savings percents for Development, PEP, Production
or total of all phases (depending on the user's selections) is
graphed against the 11 cost variables. The graph is for a
specific production quantity as selected by the user in the
DISPLAY SAVINGS menu.
The cost savings scale is the y-axis and the cost variables (one
to 11) are the x-axis. The histograms represent the total cost,T savings percents for the different cost variables. These cost
savings values represent the absolute savings of each variable
(and selected quantity) to the total baseline cost value.
