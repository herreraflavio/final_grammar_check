2.3 PHASE DESCRIPTIONS
2.3.1 BASELINE DEVELOPMENT
To model and estimate the development phase costs,
the parametric estimating group evaluated the
scope of work to be accomplished during this
period. The end product of the Development Phase
was two protoflight units and the supporting build
and test equipment.
The equipment lists in figures 2.2-1 to 2.2-4,
show the items that were modeled and estimated.
Following is a list of programmatic assumptions
that, coupled with the equipment list, details
what was included in the development baseline
costs.
1) Two protoflight (flight qualified) units were
designed and built under the Development
segment. A low level of scrap parts/
assemblies were factored into this effort.
2) Manufacturing spares were included.
3) There was a robust level of systems/
subsystems design and analysis for the
demonstration units.
4) The spacecraft/payload required the highest
possible performance/reliability -Class S
electrical parts were required. This level
of screening included RF components.
5) Traditional Space Division type contractual
requirements included high reliability,
extensive documentation, extensive
environmental-acceptance-systems testing,
narrow tolerances, expensive structural
materials, and the Aerospace Corporation
involvement.
6) All documentation was to form and
deliverable.
7) Launch vehicle interface loads and interfaces
were assumed to be worst case (complex).
8) An inert mass simulator was built to support
mass properties, tooling fit checks, some
testing, and design changes.
