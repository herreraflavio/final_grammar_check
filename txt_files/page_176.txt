The user has the additional option of specifying the format for
the graph. He/she can choose a line graph or a bar graph for
viewing cost information. Specifying the format of the graph is
possible in the menu called DISPLAY FORMAT. Sample graphical
displays are provided on the following pages. The format of the
graphical displays is representative of how all similar cost data
are displayed.
The cost information graphical displays use almost the same
headings as the table displays, space permitting. Two sample
graphical display title blocks are:
