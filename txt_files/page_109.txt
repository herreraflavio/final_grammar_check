10) LEVEL OF DESIGN/TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AND UPGRADES
This variable addresses cost/savings due to incorporation of
design and technology changes during the manufacturing
process. These changes are assumed to be of minor impact
and are more of a tuning function.Weiaht:
Oualitative Scale
B) Extensive changes to spacecraft/payload baseline; many
engineering change notices (ECN). Extensive Class 1
and Class 2 change traffic during production
activities. Changes have effect on work in progress.
1) Above "average" level of engineering changes to
baseline. Many Class 1 and Class 2 engineering changes
are implemented during production activities. Some
rework required on partially completed units.
2) "Average" amount of changes to baseline. Most of the
modifications are Class 2 or other simple refinements.
No rework to partially complete units.
3) Slight modifications or no changes to spacecraft/
payload baseline. Production activities proceed
without interruption due to incorporation of these
changes.
RCA Model Parameters
Notes:
-Changes are reflected in production and PEP activities
only.
-ECNS/ECNE cause changes to production costs.
-Increased paper designs need to be made to NEWEL & NEWST
to incorporate new components and design to mechanisms.
-Mode 2 structural items should not be affected.
