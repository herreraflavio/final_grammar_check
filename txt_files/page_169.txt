B) STATISTICAL INFORMATION DISPLAY TABLES
S This set of output tables is very similar to the previously
described Cost Information Display Tables. The major difference
between the two types of reports is that the cost information
tables contain actual dollar values while the statistical tables
contain percent values that represent the relative savings of a
specific variable or combination of variables (as selected by the
user). As with the cost information, there are three choices for
displaying the statistical information (selected from the
following DATA LEVEL Menu):
DATA LEVEL
1 -Spacecraft Totals
2 -Subsystem Level
3 -Component Parts
4 -Totals Only
1 -SPACECRAFT TOTALS operates in the same manner as described
above in COST INFORMATION DISPLAY TABLES. The ten (or less)
spacecraft/ payload summary items provided by the user (via the
Maintenance Option) appear in this output report. The component
items that are identified with each summary item have costs
aggregated and this value is divided by the sum of the baseline
costs for these same component items. This quotient is then
subtracted from 1, leaving a decimal value representing the
decimal percent savings. It is these percent savings values that
are displayed in the table.
SAVINGS % = (1 -(ADJUSTED COST/BASELINE COST)) * 100
The user has two other decisions to make when displaying the
statistical information. The first is what combination of
Design/ Development, PEP, and Production costs are to be
displayed (there are separate tables for each activity). The
second decision determines whether the statistics should be
displayed individually by variable (for those variables selected
by the user) or if all variables should be aggregated together
resulting in a composite cost impact.
The menus for selecting the desired combination of "phase of
development" and "level of cost variable statistics" are provided
below.
