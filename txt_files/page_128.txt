2.2 INPUT/MODIFY CONFIGURATION
DARPA SPACE SYSTEM COST STUDY PROGRAM
DARPASS Program Operations
Designate Mission Baseline
Input New Configuration
Modify Existing Configuration
Retrieve Configuration
Save Configuration
Execute
File Operations/Maintenance
Terminate & Return to DOS
These options are discussed together because they operate
identically. The only difference between the two options is
that INPUT NEW CONFIGURATION begins with all cost variables
set to the baseline values, while MODIFY EXISTING
CONFIGURATION displays the cost variables as they have been
input by the user.
This portion of the DARPASS session is for entry of the
spacecraft/payload "approach" that the user wishes to
price. The user's "approach" represents the conditions that
the user feels he/she can control or affect and are
simulated by selection of the appropriate cost variables.
The cost variables to be addressed by the user are divided
into two logical groupings, Primary Cost Variables and
Secondary Cost Variables with one CRT display screen for
each grouping. The user must first specify which group of
variables he/she would like to address using a menu like the
one following:
INPUT VARIABLES
Primary Cost
Secondary Cost
