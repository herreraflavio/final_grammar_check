2.3.2 BASELINE PEP -PRODUCEABILITY ENGINEERING PHASE
The PEP activity is intended to follow the
development activity. Experience in the aerospace
industry has shown that during a development
program (or during most limited quantity
spacecraft programs) the first few vehicles are
never identical. The vehicle user usually
requires slight modifications from one unit to the
next. In modeling the development (baseline), the
parametric group assumed that the development
vehicles would be similar but not identical.
PEP also represented the level of redesign and
documentation clean up required to make the
manufactured items produceable and to tune the
production process. Included in this segment
were: reviewing and tuning the design of
manufactured items, implementing changes between
the development units and the production units,
building the required MAGE and EAGE, etc.
One of the activities of PEP was to generate a
consolidated design. For example, suppose that
the vehicles produced in the next phase
(production) were identical. Drawings would need
to be configured during PEP with production as the
primary goal, where possible. To estimate this
documentation effort and design review, the itemsmodeled during the development phase were
addressed as a paper task, i.e., no new hardware
was built. The analysis effort was increased to
insure that any changes would not affect the end
item performance.
A major portion of PEP effort was directed towards
tooling and test equipment items. This effort
varied depending upon the production quantity
since more time was spent on tooling as the
required quantity increased. The tooling
documentation was assumed to be controlled by
using the same procedures as flight hardware.
The specific assumptions and scope concerning PEP
were as follows:
1) All appropriate assumptions from development
were applicable.
2) All economic conditions for PEP were
identical to development.
