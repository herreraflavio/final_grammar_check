.2.5.2.2 ADD/MODIFY MISSION DATABASES
The user must create a new database or update an existing
database (through modification of the MISSION BASELINE menu)
to make appropriate cost values available to reflect new
spacecraft missions. This is accomplished by accessing the
selection ADD/MODIFY MISSION DATABASES.
This option provides all the utilities to either update and
add records to existing mission databases or to add files
that represent new mission databases. There must be a
database for each new mission. When ADD/MODIFY MISSION
DATABASES is selected, this is the menu displayed:
Select Database
Create New Database
Use Existing Database
CREATE NEW DATABASE
When this option is chosen, there is a prompt to input the
name of the new database; ENTER FILENAME:. The DARPASS
checks to see if a "mission name" has already been created
for the database. The "mission name" and a database name
may have been input using the ADD/MODIFY MISSION SELECTIONS
function. If a mission name exists, the DARPASS will print
this name. If there is no mission name for the database,
the DARPASS also indicates that a mission name needs to be
added using the ADD/MODIFY MISSION SELECTIONS. The DARPASS
will also indicate that the database cannot be accessed
until a mission name is provided. The user receives the
following menu after the database name is input:
New Database -Utilities
1 -Read Baseline Cost Values
2 -Read Cost Variables
