3 -COMPONENT PARTS operates in the same manner as the previous
two. However, it is not a summary of the component cost
information, but provides cost data for each component part.
Essentially, the table that displays this information will be
functionally the same as the other two summary tables, SPACECRAFT
TOTALS and SUBSYSTEM LEVEL. The only difference is that the
column heading over the component parts will read "COMPONENT
SUMMARY ITEMS."
Following is an example of this type of table. Note the increase
in the number of items in the table and that these items
represent the spacecraft component parts. (Menu selections:
COMPONENT PARTS -TOTALS ONLY -COST SAVINGS VALUES -TABLE).
