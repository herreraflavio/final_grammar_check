This option runs the DARPASS program. It uses the current
configuration of variables provided by the user. The model
applies the appropriate algorithms to the baseline
spacecraft internal cost values to produce a new set of
"configuration unique" cost values. These cost values are
calculated at the spacecraft component part level.
When the user selects EXECUTE, the model processes the data
and then displays menus that permit selection of the desired
output information. There are two discrete evaluation path
choices when obtaining output information.
"Path 1" allows the user to obtain a full set of cost data
for the conceptual light satellite design, with the
configuration of cost variables input by the user.
