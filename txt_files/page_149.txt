ADD A RECORD operates in the same manner as described for
LIST A RECORD except the DARPASS prompts for the information
instead of displaying it. After the part code has been
entered,
ENTER PART CODE: 1.2.2.1.22
SELECT PHASE (1-DEVELOP, 2-PEP, 3-PRODUCTION): 2
ENTER VARIABLE (0 -12, 0 = BASLEINE): 10
ENTER OPTION (I -3): 2
ENTER PEP 5: 90
ENTER PEP 25: 91
ENTER PEP 50: 93
ENTER PEP 100: 95
ENTER PEP 150: 97
The information input by the user should be the baseline
cost values for all quantities (5, 25,..150) for each
phase. The user should utilize the EDIT A RECORD option to
enter percent reduction values for a part.
EDIT A RECORD operates much like the LIST A RECORD option
except values are modified rather than listed. Following is
an example:
ENTER PART CODE: 1.2.2.1.22
SELECT PHASE (1-DEVELOP, 2-PEP, 3-PRODUCTION): 2
GO ENTER VARIABLE (0 -12, 0 = BASELINE): 10
ENTER OPTION (1 -3): 2
ENTER PEP 5 (90): 80
ENTER PEP 25 (91): 82
ENTER PEP 50 (93): 84
ENTER PEP 100 (95): 85
ENTER PEP 150 (97): 86
The values in parentheses represent the current values
followed by the new values for that summary item as input by
the user. The information provided is the percent reduction
values or baseline cost values for all quantities (5,
25,..150) for the phase and part selected.
DELETE A RECORD eliminates an item from the database. An
example has been provided below:
ENTER PART CODE: 1.2.2.1.22
DELETE PART? (Y OR N): Y
DARPASS -Page 25
-V
