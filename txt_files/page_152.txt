The ten (or less) spacecraft summary items appear in the
appropriate output report. The component items that have
been identified with a summary item have costs aggregated
with a total cost provided for each summary item (see
Appendix B).
SPACE DIVISION SUBSYSTEM CONFIGURATION operates in the same
fashion as the previous option. It permits naming of up to
25 space division subsystem summaries. The user must again
establish the component identification codes for each
summary item. The component identification codes for all
items contained in the Development, PEP, and Production
files are provided in Appendix C.
The twenty-five (or less) space division subsystem summary
items appear in the output report. The component items that
have been identified with a summary item have costs
aggregated with a total cost provided for each summary item
(see Appendix B).
