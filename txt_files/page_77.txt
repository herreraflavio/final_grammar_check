2.1 RCA PRICE MODEL DESCRIPTION
The RCA PRICE H hardware model was selected as the cost
estimating tool for all items except software, which
was estimated using Martin Marietta's in-house model,
PCEM (software Parametric Cost Estimating Model).
PRICE H was used because:
1) The parametric estimating group has over 20 years
of modeling experience on all types of hardware
programs.
2) DARPA has access to the same model.
3) The PRICE model is the vehicle used to provide
daily program estimates.
4) The PRICE model methodology applies as an industry
standard and the results and complexity values are
representative of most aerospace companies.
5) The model is extremely flexible.
The PRICE model input parameters are designed for
running sensitivities. The parameters that are
available for change and that cause the greatest
variation in program costs are:
Quantity -number of items (development, PEP, and
production),
Weight -total weight (structural and electronic),
Engineering Complexity -"how difficult" is the
engineering effort,
Percent New Design -what percent of design is
required,
Manufacturing Complexity Values -electrical and
mechanical,
Schedule -time duration of task, and
Global Values -Management, Data, and Systems, etc.
Section 3.2 explains the "switches" (input values) that
were changed for each candidate variable and option.
