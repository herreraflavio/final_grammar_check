2.2 MODELING METHODOLOGY
The Martin Marietta concept design for "Lightsat" was
used as the starting point for the modeling effort. As
mentioned previously, the light satellite cost study
baseline is similar to the Martin Marietta "Lightsat"
design, but does not mirror it due to continual design
updates. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) was
developed as was an equipment list for the light
satellite. The equipment list varies slightly between
program phases (Development, PEP, and Production).
Figures 2.2-1 to 2.2-4 illustrate the WBS and equipment
lists used for modeling the baseline. Any change to
components to simulate the effect of a Primary or
Secondary cost variable was reflected by appropriate
changes to those same items in the succeeding phases
(i.e., PEP, Production). The dollar impacts and
percent savings statistics are provided through the
DARPASS model in either tabular or graphic format.
