2.5.2.1 ADD/MODIFY MISSION SELECTIONS
The selection of ADD/MODIFY MISSION SELECTIONS allows the
user to add, change, or delete spacecraft mission baselines
(i.e., communications-radio relay mission). When this
option is chosen, the selections currently available under
the MISSION BASELINE menu are displayed (see Section 2.1
Designate Mission Baseline). The DARPASS provides an
editor-type mode for updating this MISSION BASELINE menu.
Each added spacecraft mission baseline should be provided
with the associated database name. This database will
contain all the component parts, cost values, other cost
data associated with the mission, and the cost reduction
percentages associated with the Primary and Secondary Cost
Variables. (See example below.)

NAME DATABASE
1) COMMUNICATIONS-RADIO RELAY MISSION COMDB
2) IR -OBJECT RECOGNITION MISSION IRDB
This example shows two spacecraft mission types
(COMMUNICATIONS and IR) and the names of their associated
databases, COMDB and IRDB respectively. In order to make a
mission selection legitimate the actual database values must
be provided. This action can be accomplished with the
option ADD/MODIFY MISSION DATABASES.
