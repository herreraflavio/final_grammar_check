3.0 CANDIDATE VARIABLES
3.1 PRIMARY VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS & MECHANICS
1) USE OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT
This variable addresses the cost effect of using equipment
that already exists and is flight certified or exists in the
field and needs slight modification, versus equipment that
must be developed from scratch or requires extensive
modification to an existing design.
Weight:
Qualitative Scale
B) Essentially all equipment developed for the
spacecraft/payload will be developed from scratch; no
equipment currently exists that supports the
requirements. Some equipment is available that
performs "like" functions, but extensive redesign is
required to match item characteristics.
1) Much of the required spacecraft/payload equipment will
have to be developed from scratch. In some instances,
existing design can be used, but will require major
repackaging or similar design modification. Equipment
requirements are somewhat different from teammate's
traditional product lines.2) Much of the equipment needed for the spacecraft/payload
exists in some form. Some items require repackaging
but are functionally similar to existing requirements.
A few items will require some design modification and
subsequently require change to the drawing package.
3) Extensive use of existing equipment. Use of equipment
previously flight certified and flown on spacecraft
missions. Slight modifications and repackaging
required on some items. Some attributes of the
spacecraft bus are built around the characteristics of
the existing subsystem parts.
