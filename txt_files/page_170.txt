LEVEL OF STATISTICS
Individual Statistics
Composite Statistics
Selecting INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS furnishes a table for each
variable selected by the user during the input session.
Selecting COMPOSITE STATISTICS generates a table containing the
total reduction percents for the aggregate of all selected
variables.
The statistical information output tables appear functionally the
same as the previous cost information tables except that the
values within the table are different (percent versus dollars)
and the title headings on the tables are different. The titlesare very important for distinguishing the output informationbeing displayed. Some sample title blocks for statistical
information output tables are displayed below:
