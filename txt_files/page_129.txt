once a group of input variables has been selected, the user
receives the appropriate input prompts. The display screens
for the two (Primary and Secondary) groupings are reproduced
below.
Note that there is a "function menu" on line 25 of the
Primary and Secondary Cost Variable display screens
indicating keys that have special editing or selecting
capabilities. This menu is not shown in the user's guide,
but it is displayed on the CRT screen.

variable (i.e., baseline, option 1, option 2, or option 3).The user may change his/her selection by repositioning the
cursor with the arrow keys and pressing RETURN when the
