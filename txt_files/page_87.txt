3) A flight equivalent unit was not built during
PEP. Breadboard items or production
pathfinder hardware were built to verify
tooling, process plans, and test procedures.
4) Varying levels of design activity were
accomplished depending upon production
quantities; the greater the production
quantity, the more intense the design
activity.
5) Production lots were 5, 25, 50, 100, and 150.
6) The level of PEP did increase proportionally
with the production quantity; it increased at
a decreasing rate.
7) The appropriate build tools, test fixtures,
and test sets were included in the estimate
for PEP (see list of build tools and test
fixtures for the Development Phase).
8) Prime contractor and vendor items were
included in the PEP estimate.
9) Testing activities associated with design
modifications and changes/upgrades to test
equipment were included in PEP.
10) Design changes entertained in PEP were
defined as non-block in nature. This does
not imply that block changes cannot be
accommodated with this methodology. Rather,it demonstrates that the current estimate and
candidate variables do not include such
activities.
11) PEP was intended to be a stand alone activity
that ran parallel to the production effort.
The intent of modeling the effort this way
was to isolate the nonrecurring segment of
the production effort. An added feature of
this approach was that changes could be
evaluated prior to their incorporation during
an actual program. Thus, the user could test
the affordability of any modification.
12) There were no testing activities associated
with the PEP segment, with the exception of
test procedure tuning activities.
