2.0 DARPASS PROGRAM OPERATIONS MENU
Following the introductory screen, the model displays the
DARPASS Program Operations menu that allows access to all
operations of the DARPASS program. It also enables
highlighted selection of options with cursor control, or by
typing the first letter of each option where the selections
begin with a different letter. Where more than one
selection begins with the same letter, they are numbered.
Nevertheless, moving the cursor vertically between options
will highlight a selection. Then, pressing RETURN will
implement the selection.
