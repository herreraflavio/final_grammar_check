Next, a submenu is displayed that requires the user to
specify if SPACECRAFT TOTALS or SUBSYSTEM LEVEL is to be
selected. Following is an example: 0

2 -Subsystem Configuration
SPACECRAFT CONFIGURATION allows the user to name up to ten
(10) spacecraft summary items of his/her choosing. The user
dictates which components fall under the summary item
category by providing the component part identification
codes. These identification codes are the five (5) discrete
numbers separated by periods that are associated with each 0
component part. The codes appear as x.x.x.x.x. in the item
name (where the x's represent one or two digit numerical
values). The costs associated with a component item will
eventually be aggregated under the spacecraft summary item
name as provided by the user.
The format for the component identification codes associated
with a particular summary item may be input as a range of
component parts or as discrete parts. The format for input
of the spacecraft/payload summary items is provided below.
Note that sample responses are indicated by lower case or by
an asterisk (*) at the end of the information. The summary
codes for all items contained in the Development, PEP, and
Production files are provided in Appendix C.
