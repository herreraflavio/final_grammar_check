INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS
1 -SPACECRAFT TOTALS -The user receives from one to ten
graphical displays depending on the number of Spacecraft/Payload
summary items that have been selected by the user. Each of the
graphs represent a specific production quantity as selected in
teh DISPLAY QUANTITY menu below.
DISPLAY QUANTITY
1 -Quantity 5
2 -Quantity 25
3 -Quantity 50
4 -Quantity 100
5 -Quantity 150
The total percent cost savings values for Development, PEP,
Production or total of all phases (depending on the user's
selections) for each summary item (one to ten) is graphed against
the Primary and Secondary Cost Variables. These cost savings
values represent the relative savings of each summary item to its
own baseline cost value.
The cost savings percents are the y-axis and the cost variables
(one to 11) are the x-axis. The histograms represent the total
cost savings percents for the Primary and Secondary Cost
Variables. The x-axis is scaled for 11 variables. The only
histograms that are present are those representing the cost
variables that were selected by the user. Thus, there may be
between one and 11 histograms. The height of the histograms
represents the relative cost savings percents for the Primary or
Secondary Cost Variables for the summary item when compared to
its own baseline cost value.
There are occasions when there are fewer histograms than the
number of Primary or Secondary Cost Variables selected. This is
because some variables may have no impact on a particular summary
item.
