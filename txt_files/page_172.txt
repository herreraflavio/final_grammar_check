2 -SUBSYSTEM LEVEL operates in the same manner as described in
the previous option, SPACECRAFT TOTALS. It allows the user to
retrieve up to 25 subsystem summary items of his/her choice. The
user dictates which components fall under the summary item by
providing the component item identification codes. This
operation may be performed via the Maintenance function (see FILE
OPERATIONS/ MAINTENANCE).
The 25 (or less) subsystem summary items provided by the user
appear in this output report. The format for this statistical
information is similar to that of the cost report. The component
items that have been identified under each summary item will have
costs aggregated and a percent savings value (as compared to the
baseline) is provided for each summary item.
SAVINGS % = (1 -(ADJUSTED COST/BASELINE COST)) * 100
An example of this type of output table is provided below. The
example (as indicated by the title) is PEP, Composite Cost Effect
values. Thus, the table contains values representing the total
cost savings of all variables combined (as selected by the user)
for the PEP Phase. (Menu selections: STATISTICAL INFORMATION -
SUBSYSTEM LEVEL -PEP PHASE -COMPOSITE STATISTICS -TABLE).
