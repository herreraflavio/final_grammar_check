HELP may be accessed by pressing a single Help key (F10)
that is identified in a small help line at the bottom of the
screen and offers help text for the current, highlighted
variable. This operation is identical for all variables,
both Primary and Secondary.
When the HELP function is accessed, the current screen is
replaced by a screen displaying a description of the
variable and the four options available for each variable
(B, 1, 2, 3). The user is then able to return to the
display of the variables by pressing a single key. The
information provided by each cost variable's HELP screen is
shown in appendix A.
The menu for the other group, Secondary Cost Variables, is
provided below. It functions identically to the Primary
Cost Variables menu.
