4) MISSION LIFE -LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE/RELIABILITY REOUIRED
This variable addresses the cost impact related to length of
mission life. It also indicates the effect of more reliable
parts on component and assembly costs.
Weight:
Qualitative Scale
B) Mission requirements are for an extended mission life.
S class components -highest possible performance/
reliability required. Full up S Class parts have major
Commercial parts are available that meet performance/
reliability requirements. Mission requirements are for
a short mission life of less than two years. All
components and assemblies are of reduced reliability.
Small level of failures expected/tolerable.
1) B Class components -very stringent design
requirements. Mission requirements are for a minimum
of two or three year mission life; satellite must
operate effectively over this period. Component parts
and assemblies MTBF (mean time between failures) must
be rated/certified to exceed mission requirements.
Spacecraft reliability must insure mission success.
2) Mil standard components or less stringent design
requirements. Mission requirements are for a reduced
mission life of two to three years. Less stringent
component and assembly MTBF. Less testing involved to
insure longevity of mission. Wider tolerances
permitted on spacecraft reliability. Very small level
of failures expected/tolerated.
3) Commercial parts are available that meet performance/
reliability requirements. Mission requirements are for
a short mission life of less than two years. All
components and assemblies are of reduced reliability.
Small level of failures expected/tolerable.
