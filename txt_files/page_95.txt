3) SYSTEM MODULARITY/DESIGN MODULARITY
This variable addresses the cost impact of a modular versus
a non-modular design and how modular design affects design
and production costs.Weight:
Qualitative Scale
B) Satellite and payload are essentially non-modular in
nature. Swapping of components/assemblies achieved
only with a great degree of difficulty. Much
recertification/testing required when components or
assemblies need to be replaced. Other subsystems are
often significantly affected by changes to neighboring
subsystems.
1) Some of the more critical assemblies are modular in
nature; overall vehicle and subsystems require more
traditional satellite production methods with
subsystems more like black boxes. Other subsystems are
often affected by changes to neighboring subsystems.
2) Component parts are modular in nature; subsystems are
not. Production of individual subsystems occurs in
assembly line fashion while system assembly requires
more traditional methods. Changes to individual
subsystems do not generally affect the neighboring
subsystems. Some use of plug-in circuit boards and
common wiring busses.
3) High use of modular components and subsystems.
Production operations simulate an assembly line.
Changes to individual subsystems do not generally
affect the neighboring subsystems. Extensive use of
plug-in circuit boards and common wiring busses.
RCA Model Parameters
Notes:
-Global changes for both prime and teammates as indicated.
-None of the pure structural items/mechanisms should be
changed.
-Changes only to subsystems where modularity would enhance
assembl., and test effort, i.e., TT&C, Payload, C&DH, etc.
