9) MANUAL VERSUS AUTOMATED MANUFACTURING & TEST METHODS
This variable addresses the cost savings/added costs of
using automated, autonomous type manufacturing machine tools
versus traditional labor intensive machine tools. It also
addresses the added costs/savings of using automated test
methods.Weight:
Oualitative Scale
B) Many manufacturing operations use labor intensive,
manually operated machine tools. Continuous equipment
monitoring required. Parts need to be checked often
for equipment drift. Essentially manual testing.
Automated test tools are expensive to produce and thus
are not economically efficient.
1) Most production operations are performed on older, more
traditional machine tool equipment. Some critical
operations are performed on newer machine tools
providing some improvement in manufacturing
efficiency. Some test tools are available due to low
cost. Some enhancement to testing efficiency realized
due to use of these test tools.
2) Automated/computer enhanced manufacturing methods are
used in most complex operations. These tools reduce
production costs. Tools are available on the factory
-floor -no special equipment is purchased. Test tools
are available in most critical aspects of testing
activities. Significant improvement over manual
testing.
3) Extensive use of automated manufacturing methods. No
special equipment is purchased to support specific
production operations. Currently available are a
complex set of numerically controlled machines and
other computer enhanced production tools that improve
production efficiency. Full complement of automated
test tools that significantly increase efficiency of
test operations.
