The capabilities of each selection are detailed below:
READ BASELINE COST VALUES requests the name of the file that
contains the baseline cost values. There are 11 baseline
cost values for each component part: one development, five
PEP (one for each production quantity), and five
production. The DARPASS reads in the file of baseline cost
values and then returns to the NEW DATABASE -UTILITIES
menu.
READ COST VARIABLES reads in the Primary and/or Secondary
Cost Variables. The DARPASS then prorpts for the following
information:
ENTER FILZNAME:
SPECIFY PHASE (1-DEVELOP, 2-PEP, 3-PROD):
SPECIFY Quantity (5, 25, 50, 100, 150):
SPECIFY VARIABLE (1 -12):
The DARPASS reads in the cost reduction percentages for the
selected phase, production quantity, and variable for all
options (one to three). That is, each file should contain
three cost options for each variable.
