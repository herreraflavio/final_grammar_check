UPDATE BASELINE COST VALUES allows a user to replace
existing baseline cost files with new baseline cost files.
The user is prompted for the post processed filename that
contains the cost values for development, PEP, and
production. This function will not destroy already existing
Primary and Secondary Cost Variable cost reduction records.
UPDATE COST VARIABLES permits updating of the Primary and
Secondary Cost Variable reduction percentages. The DARPASS
prompts the user for the following information:
Phase (I-DEV, 2-PEP, 3-PROD):
Quantity (5, 25, 50, 100, 150):
Variable (0-11) (0 -BASELINE):
Option (1 -3):
The user needs to specify the summary codes of the items
that are to be changed and their new reduction percentages:
PROVIDE COMPONENT SUMMARY CODES AND THEIR CORRESPONDING
REDUCTION PERCENTS:
FORMAT: RANGE X.X.X.X.X. <CR> X.X.X.X.X. ###.##
DISCRETE X.X.X.X.X. <CR> <CR> ###.##
WHERE X.X.X.X.X. -- SUMMARY CODES
###.##-- PERCENT CHANGE
