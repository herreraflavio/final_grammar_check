3.3 OTHER COST VARIABLES EVALUATED
1) PRIME CONTRACTOR/TEAMMATE EXPERIENCE
The variable addresses the cost impact of using contractors
that have experience in developing flight hardware versus
those that have little or no experience. The actual
equipment needed does not currently exist (as with Variable
1), requiring a given knowledge level to adequately develop
the necessary components.
Weight:
Oualitative Scale
B) Poor contractor experience. Contractors have little or
no experience in developing flight hardware. Products
are not part of the company's regular product line.
The equipment represents new technology to the
company. Much interfacing will be required to derive
the necessary requirements. Consultants may be
required to supplement existing contractor knowledge.
1) Moderate contractor experience. Contractors appear to
have the technological capabilities to develop the
required products. Company has limited experience in
developing flight hardware. No similar products have
been developed by the contractor. Current product
lines are similar in terms of the level of technology
required.
2) Good contractor experience. Teammates are known for
their capabilities in their respective product lines.
Technological product requirements are well within
their normal lines of business. In some cases similar
products have been developed.
3) Excellent contractor experience. Teammates have
extensive experience in individual product areas.
Teammates are industry leaders in their respective
product lines. Product requirements closely match
existing product lines although existing equipment is
still not available. Level of technology not an issue.
