2.5.3 CONFIGURE OUTPUT REPORTS
The third option from the PROGRAM CONFIGURATION MENU lets
the user configure the output reports (See below). It
provides the ability to summarize a group of co ,ponent parts
under a summary name.
Program Configuration
1 -Add/Modify Mission Selections
2 -Add/Modify Mission Databases
3 -Configure Output Reports
The reader should reference Section 2.4 of this document to
see how this option is applied. This section details how
the user can designate the desired output information. From
Section 2.4, the first level output decision addresses the
data level. The first menu for COST INFORMATION DISPLAY
SELECTIONS is shown below:
Data Level
1 -Spacecraft Totals
2 -Subsystem Level
3 -Component Parts
4 -Totals Only
The first and second selections under this menu (SPACECRAFT
TOTALS and SUBSYSTEM LEVEL) can be specifically configured
by the user. The third option, COMPONENT PARTS, cannot be
configured because it represents the lowest available cost
summary level.
When the user selects CONFIGURE OUTPUT REPORTS from the
PROGRAM CONFIGURATION menu, a prompt is displayed that
requires the user to indicate the database being configured:
