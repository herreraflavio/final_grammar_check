4) CONFIGURATION OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS
This variable addresses the effect on cost of electronic
components due to repackaging requirements and associated
modifications.~Weight:
Oualitative Scale
B) Size and weight are major considerations in electronic
components design and production. Many circuit layouts
must be rearranged. Individual electronic discretes
are considered for replacerent.
1) Size and weight affects the packaging and circuit
density of many of the electronic components. Many
boards require rearrangement/ packaging.
2) Size and weight constraints have a lesser impact on
circuit density and packaging requirements. Some
repackaging must be considered.
3) Size and weight factors not an issue in packaging the
electronic components. Boards can be used "as is" with
little modification to basic circuit layout.
