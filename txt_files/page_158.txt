10) LEVEL OF DESIGN/TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AND UPGRADES addresses
cost changes that result from incorporation of design and
technology modifications during the manufacturing process.
These alterations are assumed to exert a minor impact and
more of a tuning function.
B) Extensive changes to spacecraft/payload baseline; many
Engineering Change Notices (ECN). Extensive Class 1 and
Class 2 change traffic during production activities.
Changes have effect on work in progress.
1) Above "average" level of engineering changes to baseline.
Many Class 1 and Class 2 engineering changes are implemented
during production activities. Some rework on partially
completed units required.
2) "Average" amount of changes to baseline. Most of the
modifications are Class 2 or other simple refinements. No
rework to partially complete units.
3) No changes or only slight modifications to spacecraft/
payload baseline. Production activities proceed without
interruption due to incorporation of the changes.
11) LAUNCH VEHICLE SIZE AND WEIGHT CONSTRAINTS addresses the
cost impact to development when the spacecraft/payload is
approaching the limits of the launch vehicle lift
capabilities.
m B) Very tight size/weight constraints due to launch vehicle
limitations. Essentially no margin for growth in the
spacecraft/payload preliminary design. Result is an
inflexible design.
1) Tight size/weight constraints with 5-10% growth margins.
Any design changes may require redesign of existing
subsystem components. Major rework to design is required
when weight limitations exceeded.
2) More relaxed size/weight constraints; 10-20% growth
margins. Most changes can be made with a minimum degree of
impact on existing components and subsystems. Some small
redesign efforts may be required to incorporate changes that
result in weight growth.
3) Size and weight not projected to be an issue. Large margin
for growth (+20%). Little or no redesign required when
incorporating changes that result in weight growth.
