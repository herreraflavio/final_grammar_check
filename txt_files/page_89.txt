PRIMARY COST VARIABLES
1) USE OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT
This variable addresses the cost effect of using equipment
that already exists and is flight certified or exists in the
field and needs slight modification, versus equipment that
must be developed from scratch or requires extensive
modification to an existing design.
2) TESTING APPROACH
This variable addresses the cost effect of alternate testing
approaches. It encompasses the level of testing, i.e.,
system, subsystem, module, etc., the types of testing, and
the frequency of testing.
3) SYSTEM MODULARITY/DESIGN MODULARITY
This variable addresses the cost impact of a modular versus
a non-modular design and how modular design affects design
and production costs.
4) MISSION LIFE -LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE/RELIABILITY REOUIRED
This variable addresses the cost impact related to length ofmission life. It also indicates the effect of more reliableparts on component and assembly costs.
5) MECHANICAL/STRUCTURAL MATERIALS AND TOLERANCES
This variable relates cost to the types of materials used to
produce the spacecraft/payload and the precision to which
these parts must be produced.
