5) MECHANICAL/STRUCTURAL MATERIALS AND TOLERANCES
This variable relates cost to the types of materials used to
produce the spacecraft/payload and the precision to which
these parts must be produced.
Weifht:
Oualitative Scale
B) New materials, composites, or difficult alloys. Parts
and assemblies have very narrow tolerances. Some parts
will require special manufacturing/assembly knowledge.
Special cutting tools for machining operations will be
required. Best available material and assembly
techniques employed.
1) Relatively new material/composites requiring special
manufacturing or assembly expertise. Special beryllium
and titanium compounds used for some structural
components. Tolerances are difficult on many parts and
assemblies. Properties of material are known but
limited experience in working with material. Some
special tools may be required.
2) Typical material/composites with close but comfortable
tolerances. Some attributes of the manufacturing/
assembly process require special considerations. Less
extensive quality control required for monitoring
production effort.
3) Simple aluminum composites or equivalent. No special
tooling required for machining operations. Tolerancesare fairly easy to maintain on standard machine tools.
Weight savings are not a factor.
RCA Model Parameters
Notes:
-Impact on cost for development, PEP, and production
activities.
-Mechanical/structural items are the only parts receiving
changes to complexity, weight, globals, and platform.
-Change integration and test for mechanical/structural
items only.
