The user has two other decisions to make when viewing this cost
information. The first is what combination of Design/
Development, PEP, and Production costs will be displayed (there
are separate cost tables for each activity). The previous
example displays a table that reflects the DEVELOPMENT PHASE,
TOTAL COST VALUES.
The second decision determines whether or not the cost values
will be displayed as total cost values, unit cost values (total
dollars/ production quantity), or cost savings values. The
previous table reflects an example of TOTAL COST VALUES. COST
SAVINGS VALUES are the discrete dollars saved compared to the
baseline costs, due to the approach selected using the Primary
and Secondary Cost Variables. The menus for selecting the
desired combination of "phase of development" and "type of cost"
output information are shown below.
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT
1 -Development Phase
2 -PEP Phase
3 -Production Phase
4 -Totals Only
COST VALUE
Total Cost
Unit Cost
Cost Savings
The output display for PEP or Production and unit cost values or
cost savings values are essentially the same as our DEVELOPMENT
PHASE TOTAL COST sample table, except for the title line and the
cost values themselves. The title lines are very important in
distinguishing the output information being displayed. Some
sample title blocks for specific output tables are displayed
below:
B-5
S-% -. ."
